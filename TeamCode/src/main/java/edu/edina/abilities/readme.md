## Abilities

An ability is a sequence of events that can be used to accomplish a purpose.  For instance, 
many people have the ability to ride a bicicle, which involves pedaling, steering, watching
for obstacles, and braking.

A robot will have abilities, too, which build on the basic operations that can be triggered.  
For instance, if the bot can drive forward and stop based on controller input, we could create
an ability to drive forward for two seconds and then stop.  

That is obviously a very simple example, but we could make a more complex ability like "drive 
forward on foot, then left one foot, then deploy the arm with the grabber open".  Or whatever.  
Abilities could be used to build an autonomous mode or be triggered by an operator in TeleOp
mode.
